/**
 * Represents a unique page within the application. Pages are part of the <em>internal</em> structure of a Tapestry
 * application; end developers who refer to "page" are really referring to the {@link #getRootComponent() root
 * component} of the actual page.
 * <p/>
 * Starting in release 5.2, the nature of pages changed considerably. Pages are no longer pooled instances. Instead,
 * pages are shared instances (per locale) but all internal <em>mutable</em> state is stored inside
 * {@link PerthreadManager}. Page construction time is considered to extend past the
 * {@link PageLifecycleListener#containingPageDidLoad()} lifecycle notification. This is not quite perfect from a
 * threading point-of-view (arguably, even write-once-read-many fields should be protected by synchronized blocks or
 * other mechanisms). At best, we can be assured that the entire page construction phase is protected by a single
 * synchronized block (but not on the page itself). An ideal system would build the page bottom to top so that all
 * assignments could take place in constructors, assigning to final fields. Maybe some day.
 * <p/>
 * The Page object is never visible to end-user code. The page also exists to provide a kind of service to components
 * embedded (directly or indirectly) within the page.
